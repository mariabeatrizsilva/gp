    " * Compute an implicit MLS function approximating a 3D point cloud with given (but possibly unnormalized) normals.\n",
    " * Sample the implicit function on a 3D volumetric grid.\n",
    " * Apply the marching tets algorithm to extract a triangle mesh of this zero level set.\n",
    " * Experiment with various MLS reconstruction parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task is to construct an implicit function `f(x)` defined on all `x`  R<sup>3</sup> whose zero level set contains (or at least passes near) each input point. That is, for every point `pi` in the point cloud, we want `f(pi) = 0`. Furthermore, `∂f` (the isosurface normal) evaluated at each point cloud location should approximate the point's normal provided as input."

    " The poisson recostruction first and foremost has much fewer artifacts than my recognstruction. This is probably because the global nature of the poisson reconstruction helps it better deal with noise. Also, the reconstructions are less rigid. If you focus on specifically the cat's mouth, my reconstruction is much more jagged/rigid compared to the more flat result from MeshLab. Additionally, with the poisson reconstruction, you can see details on the cat's ears (see below), which you cannot with my MLS reconstruction(at least as it's implemented here). Some of this may be due to the fact I have to increase how fine my grid is, but there must be other factors.\n",

    "* *(2 points)* In [Interpolating and Approximating Implicit Surfaces from Polygon Soup](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Shen-IAI-2004-08/index.html) normals are used differently to define the implicit surface. Instead of generating new sample points offset in the positive and negative normal directions, the paper uses the normal to define a linear function for each point cloud point: the signed distance to the tangent plane at the point.\n",
    "Then the values of these linear functions are interpolated by MLS. Implement Section 3.3 of the paper and append to your report a description of the method and how it compares to the original point-value-based approach.\n",
